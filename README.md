# TempMap
A package following Stone et al. (2022) in using the method described in Neustadt & Kochanek (2022) (NK22) to form temperature perturbation maps for AGN accretion disks. The methodology is originally described in NK22, with small adjustments in Stone (2022). 

The repository is organized as follows:
* /temp_prof - The python package
* /Examples - Example Jupyter notebooks detailing two use cases for the package (one with simulated data and one with real data)
* /Paper - Results from Stone et al. (2022), including GIFs of fit spectra, AGN parameters, and output temperature maps
